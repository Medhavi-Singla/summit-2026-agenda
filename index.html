     <b> Operationalize AI: Why Now Is the Moment for Credit Unions to Act</b><br>
      Artificial intelligence is no longer a future promise for financial services. Across banking and fintech, AI is already moving beyond personal productivity advantages to reshape operating models, consumer experience, marketing, risk management, and growth strategies. Many have associated its transformative change with that of the Industrial Revolution. The question for credit unions is no longer if AI will matter, but how quickly and effectively it will be operationalized.<br><br>



This opening keynote sets the stage for CULytics Summit 2026, offering a clear-eyed view of where AI stands today across financial services, what has changed in the last 12–18 months, and why this moment demands action. The keynote will explore how AI is moving out of experimentation and into the core of day-to-day operations, with implications for efficiency, member engagement, lending, fraud, and competitive positioning.
<br><br>


The keynote issues a call to action for credit unions: now is the time to plan, prepare, and execute. Credit unions that wait may find themselves reacting to change instead of shaping it. (seems a negative or threatening . . . can we not say same thing but being positive by saying the opposite like “Credit unions that act now have a competitive advantage, lower operational costs, more efficient, driving growth and improving service sooner”)
<br><br>


The session also introduces the four pillars of the CULytics Summit, guiding the conference’s peer-led discussions:<ul>

  <li>From Insight to Impact: Production & Measurement</li>
  <li>Collective Intelligence: Peer Patterns That Scale</li>
  <li>Trustworthy Analytics: Governance, Explainability & Privacy</li>
  <li>Decision & Action. How credit unions turn what they’ve learned into concrete next steps.</li></ul>
  Together, these pillars frame a practical path forward, grounded in real-world implementations, measurable outcomes, and shared learning. The keynote sets expectations for a Summit focused not on theory or hype, but on what’s working now, what’s coming next, and how credit unions can confidently push off from the starting blocks.

     <b> From Strategy to Improved ROA: Prioritizing Enterprise Investments for Measurable Business Impact</b><br>
    Many credit unions have no shortage of strategic initiatives competing for attention and investment, ranging from core modernization and digital experience to AI and analytics, yet struggle to translate that ambition into measurable improvements in ROA, efficiency, or member outcomes.<br><br>
In this session, Shira Spector shares how Valley Strong Credit Union approaches enterprise investment decisions through a disciplined framework designed to prioritize initiatives that drive measurable business impact. Framed at the executive level, the discussion explores how leadership defines objectives, evaluates competing proposals, and builds a cohesive roadmap that aligns people, process, data, and technology around outcomes that matter.
<br><br>
Shira will outline the decision framework her teams use to assess each initiative and shape the enterprise roadmap, including:<ul>

<li>What problem are we solving and why does it matter now</li>
  <li>What results are intended and how they will be measured</li>
<li>What headwinds and tailwinds affect success</li>
  <li>What investments are required across people, process, and technology</li></ul>
To ground the framework, she will reference examples of how these questions have been applied in practice, helping practitioners understand how strategic intent translates into execution, prioritization, ownership, and adoption.
<br><br>


Attendees will leave with a repeatable approach for moving strategic initiatives from ideas and pilots into production-ready programs with clear ownership, metrics, and business impact.

     <b> Executive Playbook: Turning AI into ROI.</b><br>
    AI is no longer a “data team project”. It’s a CEO agenda item tied to growth, efficiency, and trust. In this C-suite panel, credit union CEOs and CSOs share how they are moving from promising pilots to production programs: the operating model, governance, and measurement discipline that turns AI into business outcomes. You’ll hear the real decisions behind scaling AI, where they are investing first, what they are stopping doing, how they are aligning the executive team on a smaller set of KPIs, and how they are building feedback loops to monitor both AI performance and business impact. Walk away with a practical blueprint for prioritization, resourcing, and proving ROI that credit unions can apply immediately.

     <b> From Roadmaps to Reality: Preparing for an AI-Driven Operating Model</b><br>AI is rapidly moving from an experimental capability to the core of how financial institutions will operate. While most credit unions now have an AI roadmap, few have clarity on what an AI-powered operating model may look like: including concrete use cases and patterns where AI guides service interactions, supports lending decisions, anticipates member needs, and streamlines internal workflows.
<br><br>


In this vision-setting session, you’ll hear how BCU [and peers? – tbd] are defining their next 3-5 year AI vision, and what specific steps they’re taking today to prepare, sequence investments, and reduce risk. Core enablers include scalable CRM platforms, strong data governance, API-based architectures, and the operating discipline required to integrate these into daily workflows.
<br><br>


Framed for both executives and senior practitioners, the discussion explores how credit unions can think big about AI’s role in the organization while making disciplined moves today.

     <b> CULytics Transformation Challenge: Peer Patterns from AI in Production</b><br>The CULytics Transformation Challenge is the Summit’s most fast-paced, peer-driven session, designed to surface transferable patterns from real AI and analytics initiatives already in production across credit unions.<br><br>



In this session, finalist credit unions present concise, outcomes-focused case spotlights highlighting what they built, why they prioritized the use case, how they navigated governance and risk, and what it took to drive adoption across the organization. Rather than deep technical walkthroughs, the focus is on how decisions were made, how efforts were sequenced, and what lessons emerged that other credit unions can adapt locally.
<br><br>


Across multiple case examples, attendees will see:<ul>

  <li>How peers identified and prioritized high-impact use cases</li>
  <li>How buy-in was secured across leadership, business, and technology teams</li>
  <li>How governance and guardrails enabled progress rather than slowed it</li>
<li>What changed once solutions moved into production, including KPIs tied to growth, efficiency, member experience, fraud reduction, and cost-to-serve</li>
  </ul>

As patterns emerge across finalists, facilitators will synthesize key takeaways and reusable artifacts, helping the audience connect individual success stories into shared learning.
<br><br>


The session concludes with Transformation Challenge recognition and a summary of the peer patterns and practical insights attendees can apply immediately within their own credit unions.

 <div class="overview"><b>AI Without Fear: A Compliance Playbook for Credit Unions</b><br>Many credit unions want the benefits of AI but stall when governance, risk, and examiner expectations create uncertainty. In this session, Ray K. Ragan presents a compliance‑first playbook that reframes AI adoption as a governance and risk management exercise tailored to credit unions. Drawing on his experience in defense AI and credit‑union leadership, Ray delivers non‑technical, practical guidance that helps teams align governance, vendor oversight, documentation practices, and examiner engagement with real‑world AI work.
<br><br>
Ray will present a governance‑centered decision framework focused on compliance priorities: establishing oversight and escalation paths; conducting focused risk assessments that address model, data, vendor, operational, and reputational risk; defining controls and monitoring to protect model integrity and member data; preparing examiner‑aligned documentation and reporting practices; and clarifying ownership and review cadences for ongoing compliance. Each element is illustrated with credit‑union‑relevant scenarios so attendees can see how governance choices shape outcomes.<br><br>
Attendees will leave with clear, actionable knowledge they can apply immediately: how to frame AI proposals for boards and examiners; the right governance questions to ask when evaluating pilots; a compliance lens for assessing vendor relationships and model risk; practical approaches to documenting decisions and testing; and a short, prioritized set of next steps to move a pilot toward sustainable, examiner‑aligned operation. These are practical takeaways designed to help credit unions operationalize AI within a governance and compliance framework.</div>

      <div class="overview"><b>Operationalizing Trust: A Panel Discussion of AI Governance and Risk Management</b><br>A panel of risk and governance leaders will explore how credit unions can build regulator‑aligned AI governance that protects member trust while enabling practical adoption. The conversation focuses on real governance choices—who owns oversight, what formal structures and escalation paths work in practice, and how institutions keep examiners informed when regulatory guidance is still evolving.<br><br>
Panelists will discuss stakeholder alignment and education, practical approaches to defining risk appetite, vendor oversight, focused risk assessment practices, and how to weigh the risk of inaction against the risks of deployment. The discussion emphasizes translating technical risk into board‑level language, creating broad ownership across functions, and keeping governance effective without becoming a bottleneck.<br><br>
Attendees will leave with clear, actionable guidance: the right governance questions to ask, ways to frame AI risk for boards and examiners, and a short list of prioritized next steps to advance governance aligned deployments.</div>

The result? Delays, compliance risks, and missed opportunities to deliver truly member-centric decisions. This session unveils a breakthrough: how credit unions can leapfrog traditional analytics by building an AI-powered, conversational analytics hub that puts actionable insights directly into the hands of decision makers—no coding required.<br><br>



Drawing on a real-world case study from CULytics, Steven Simpson will demonstrate how to harness leading AI tools (AWS QuickSight, Azure AI, Databricks Genie, Snowflake Cortex) and data governance-endorsed datasets (“single view of member,” “summary of transactions,” “quantified behavioral engagement,” “profit” tables) to create an interactive Teams/SharePoint portal. This hub empowers every user to ask natural-language questions—“How many new loans this quarter?” “Which members show rising engagement?”—and instantly receive dynamic, Power BI-style visualizations, grids, and recommended follow-up questions. No more waiting for custom dashboards or IT support.
<br><br>
Key takeaways include:<ul>
<li>A governance-first framework for selecting, transforming, and endorsing datasets for LLM training—ensuring privacy, accuracy, and regulatory alignment from day one.</li>
<li>Practical strategies for integrating AI platforms to build conversational interfaces that democratize analytics and accelerate decision-making.</li>
<li>Step-by-step guidance on designing “quick Q\&A” prompts for core metrics, embedding drill-down visualizations, and operationalizing AI in a way that’s examiner-ready and sustainable.</li>
<li>Essential questions for evaluating AI vendors, assessing data readiness, and framing proposals for boards and examiners.</li>
  </ul>
Attendees will leave equipped to break down data silos, operationalize AI responsibly, and drive member growth, service excellence, and competitive agility. This is not just an evolution—it’s a revolution in how credit unions turn data into strategic advantage.</div>

      <div class="overview"><b>From Data Silos to Instant Insights: Suncoast Credit Union's Automated Research Assistant Powered by Databricks Genie</b><br>Credit unions often face a bottleneck where complex business questions—spanning member behavior, loan performance, profitability trends, and engagement metrics—require deep analyst involvement to translate into queries, build models, or generate reports. This delays decision-making and limits agility in a competitive landscape. In this hands-on follow-up session, William Langford, Director of Data Analytics at Suncoast Credit Union (Florida's largest credit union), demonstrates how Suncoast has deployed an automated "research assistant" using Databricks Genie on top of carefully governed, transformed data tables to empower decision-makers with natural-language querying.

 <br><br>

Building on proven data governance practices, Suncoast has endorsed and prepared key datasets—such as single-view member profiles, transaction summaries, quantified behavioral engagement scores, and profitability metrics—for seamless integration into Databricks' ecosystem. William will walk attendees through the real-world implementation: configuring Genie as a conversational AI layer that interprets plain-English questions, automatically generates and optimizes multiple underlying queries to navigate the data landscape, identifies the most accurate path to answers, and delivers results with suggested actionable strategies. Examples include queries like "What member segments show the highest engagement drop-off in the last quarter, and what retention tactics should we prioritize?" or "How has profitability trended across auto loan products by region, factoring in recent behavioral changes?"

 <br><br>

Attendees will see live demonstrations of Genie in action—how it handles complexity that would traditionally challenge analysts, reduces query development time from days to seconds, suggests follow-up questions or refinements, and maintains full governance, auditability, and compliance alignment. William will share measurable benefits: accelerated insights for executive and operational teams, reduced analyst workload for high-value tasks, improved decision speed, and enhanced member outcomes through faster, data-informed strategies—all while preserving data security and regulatory standards.

 <br><br>

This session is ideal for analytics leaders, CIOs, executives, and operations teams seeking to move beyond static dashboards and traditional BI. Attendees will leave with actionable takeaways: best practices for preparing governed datasets for LLM-powered tools like Genie; key governance and prompt engineering considerations for credit union environments; strategies to measure adoption and ROI (e.g., time saved, insight velocity, and business impact); and a step-by-step guide to piloting a similar research assistant in their own organization. Discover how Suncoast is turning governed data into an empowering, always-on intelligence partner that drives real competitive advantage.</div>

      <div class="overview"><b>From Pilot to Proof: Scaling M365 Copilot Across a Credit Union</b><br>As generative artificial intelligence rapidly enters the financial services landscape, many credit unions have initiated pilot programs to explore productivity gains and service enhancements. However, few have progressed from limited experimentation to enterprise-wide adoption supported by formal governance structures and measurable return on investment.<br><br>
At the CULytics Summit this March, Chase Clelland—SVP of People and AI, will present a real-world case study from Grow Financial Federal Credit Union detailing the strategic deployment of Microsoft 365 Copilot across the organization. This initiative was intentionally designed as a workforce transformation effort rather than a technology pilot—embedding AI within existing workflows, establishing a comprehensive governance framework to ensure responsible and compliant use, and implementing quantitative methods to assess operational impact.
<br><br>The session will examine three primary outcome areas:<ul>
<li>Enhanced communication and service efficiency through AI-assisted drafting, personalization, and response optimization</li>
<li>Accelerated development of policies, procedures, and operational plans within familiar tools</li>
<li>Structured measurement of productivity improvements, time savings, and cost-equivalent value to demonstrate tangible ROI</li></ul>
Attendees will gain practical insight into the organizational change strategies, governance considerations, and analytical frameworks necessary to scale generative AI in a regulated environment while delivering verifiable business outcomes.
<br><br>This presentation is designed for leaders seeking to move beyond experimentation toward sustainable, value-driven AI adoption.
